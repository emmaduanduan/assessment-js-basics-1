// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning
// I put the correct order in an array in case it shows syntax error because I am wriring in JS document.

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "All information will be collected to see what features the product needs to have."
const Design = "Information collected will be input into the design."
const Implementation = "All the components will be implemented."
const TestingIntegration = "When code is completed, every module will be released to be tested. If there are any bugs and defects, developers need to fix them."
const Maintain = "When the product is put in the production environment, maitainance is required. If there are any issues coming up, developers need to take care of them as soon as possible."
